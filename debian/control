Description: a random grabbag of Pd objects by Hans-Christoph Steiner
 The 'hcs' library is a random grabbag of objects that are experiments
 that sometimes lead to full-fledged libraries.  There are objects for
 getting UNIX file and permissions information, Pd GUI manipulation,
 handling filenames, and more.
